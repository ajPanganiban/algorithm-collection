# Algorithm Collection

algorithm-collection is a library of algorithms for solving equations, linear programs, matching problems, etc.

## Structure

The library will be categorized per algorithm nature (RootFinders, LinearProgramSolver, Matching).
Each category will then have several algorithms and each algorithm will have a designated subdirectory.
Inside these subdirectories are the codes and a readme file to describe the algorithm.

## Contributing

Pull requests and Issues are welcome. 
Discussions will also be very much appreciated. 


All results of this library are open for public use.
